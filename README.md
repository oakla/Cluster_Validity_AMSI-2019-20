# Playing with Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

A collection of scripts and notebooks written to play with the application of unsupervised learning algorithms (i.e. clustering).



## DBSCAN
### [DBSCAN applied to the iris dataset](Scripts\DBSCAN_Iris.py)
### [DBSCAN applied to the digits dataset](Scripts\DBSCAN_digits.py)
DBSCAN seems like an inappropriate algorithm for the digits dataset, so it seemed interesting to find out how well it performed

## K-Means
### [K-Means applied to the iris dataset](Scripts\k_means_iris_benchmark.py)
### [K-Means applied to the iris dataset](Scripts\k_means_digits_benchmark.py)
