# Cluster_Validity_AMSI-2019

A collection of scripts and notebooks written to explore parameter selection for unsupervied learning (i.e. clustering) techniques.

This was done as part of a [summer research project](https://vrs.amsi.org.au/student-profile/alex-oakley/) funded by the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institure (AMSI).
